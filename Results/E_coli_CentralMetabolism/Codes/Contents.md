2. forward_pass.py - Python implementation of the Guided BFS (Refer main manuscript for the details)

3. generate_partitions.py - Python function file that generates parititions of numbers for generating a given sum. This function is called in the main implementation (1)

4. find_jaccard_between_paths - Python function file that will calculate the jaccard values between the sub-networks generated by (1) and plot the histogram.
